Markov Bot that tracks your messages and spits out a Markov chain like your messages :)

## Requirements

- discord.py 
- markovify
- colorama (optional)

## Setup
Although Milkovify works, I wouldn't recommend running it unless you know what you're doing

- Clone Repo
- Under Milkovify/Core/config.py edit TOKEN to be your bot token.
- Edit USER_ID to be your user_id. 
- Run Main.py

## Extending Milkovify (future stuff)
- More General chat commands
- More Users
- More fun.
